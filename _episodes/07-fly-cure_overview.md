# Fly-CURE Overview

The Fly-CURE is a consortium of diverse universities and colleges across the US teaching a Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (Fly-CURE). The Fly-CURE is a 10-15 week undergraduate research experience where students characterize and map a novel mutant stock of Drosophila melanogaster. Students use techniques in classical and molecular genetics as well as bioinformatics during a semester long lab course (Fig. 1).

Step 2 is a model of complementation mapping conducting utilizing the BDSC 2R deficiency kit. Locations that fail to complement are further assessed by additional mapping. Step 3 includes various molecular techniques including DNA extraction, primer design, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sanger sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis to identify a heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).  

# Genetic screen

Drosophila EMS mutants were screened in the background of blocked apoptosis (Dark82) to search for genetic regulators of cell growth and cell division (Fig. 2). The Fly-CURE was developed to have undergraduate researchers map these novel Drosophila mutants.

# Outcomes

To-date, this project has provided research exposure to over 300 undergraduate researchers within the classroom setting. These undergraduate researchers have successfully mapped several EMS mutants which have led to local and national scientific presentations by students, as well as four peer-reviewed publications (Fig. 3).
